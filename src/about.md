# Why yet another SCE blog (corporate software engineer's blog)

For over twenty years, I've been navigating the ever-evolving landscape of corporate software development.  Sure, I love the technical aspects â€“ the thrill of a complex problem solved, the elegance of a well-crafted function. But the human element is just as fascinating. This blog is where I delve into both.

Here, you won't just find code snippets and technical deep dives (though there will be some of that!). I'm more interested in exploring the intersection of technology and the corporate environment. How do new languages and frameworks get adopted? How do different teams approach problem-solving? What cultural shifts accompany the latest tech trends?

Take functional programming (FP) for example. It's my coding kryptonite, but convincing some colleagues of its benefits can be like explaining astrophysics to a hamster. We'll dissect these challenges, the communication hurdles, and the unexpected wins.

This blog is my window into the fascinating world of corporate tech adoption.  We'll explore the triumphs and the inevitable hiccups, the communication battles, and the unexpected ways people integrate new tools into their workflow.  So, whether you're a developer, a manager, or simply curious about the human side of tech, join me on this journey.  Let's see how the gears of code and culture mesh (or sometimes clash) in the corporate machine.
